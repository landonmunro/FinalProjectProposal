    <h1>1. TickTock</h1>
<h1>2. Created by Landon Munro</h1>
<h1>3. A program that is able to create a stop watch and timer clock.</h1>
<h1>4.This program will be created on python using the 'time' library on python</h1>
<h1>5.Last updated on March 24, 2023</h1>
<h1>6.The likely features 'TickTock' is going to have is the ability to have a countdown timer that will
    stop when time is up. Another feature hopefully is a lap timer built in.</h1>
<h1>7.Features that are not prioritized may just be telling the time in other time zones and the time that it is wherever
    the program is being run.</h1>
<h1>8.The basic features will be functions that we touched on during class and also using things like the 'import' 
    command to import 'time'. It will be constructed like the projects we have completed in class.</h1>
<h1>9. There may be some advanced technical features that we have not used yet however I am not sure at this moment
    what they are quite yet.
